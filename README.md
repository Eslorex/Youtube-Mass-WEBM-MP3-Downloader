So basically, youtube only provides videos as webm files. If you want to download mp3 files you have to make conversion with ffmpeg. And this program does it automatically for you. But before that, don't forget to install python and needed libraries also FFMPEG.

1. Download FFMPEG from here --> https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

2. After installing python, run install_libraries.py so it can install required packages.

3. Once you downloaded FFMPEG you need to rename the main folder as "ffmpeg" to avoid version problems.

4. Then put the file in this path like this: MP3 Downloader\ffmpeg\bin 

I'm not able to provide the ffmpeg file since github doesn't allow big files in repositories. Thats why you have to download it and rename it by yourself.

And its done! You have completely **free** mp3 downloader. And works with any amount of lines of Youtube URLs. You can use it to easily download many mp3 files to use it for your SoundPad.

Known Issues:

Since its a console program (I was too lazy to make UI for it) , it might not get the last url so pressing Enter again will make it work.

It will not show any progress when converting file into mp3 from webm. And it might take a bit for it to convert mp3 depending on your pc specs so don't worry when nothing happens on console screen. Just wait for the progress. You can see the progress if you refresh the folder.
