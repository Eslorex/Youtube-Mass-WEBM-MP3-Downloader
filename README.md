- Youtube Mass MP3 Downloader

So basically, youtube only provides videos as webm files. If you want to download mp3 files you have to make conversion with ffmpeg. And this program does it automatically for you. But before that, don't forget to install python and needed libraries.

After installing python, run install_libraries.py so it can install required packages.


Which you can download from here --> https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Once you downloaded ffmpeg you need to rename the main folder as "ffmpeg" to avoid version problems.

Then put the file in this path like this: MP3 Downloader\ffmpeg\bin 

I'm not able to provide the ffmpeg file since github doesn't allow big files in repositories. Thats why you have to download it and rename it by yourself.

And its done. You have free mp3 downloader. And works with any amount of lines of Youtube URLs. You can use it to easily download many mp3 files to use it for your SoundPad.

Known Issues:
Since its a console program (I was too lazy to make UI for it) , it might not get the last url so pressing Enter again will make it work.

It works as WEBM downloader without ffmpeg. But it will output errors. I don't know its an issue though.
